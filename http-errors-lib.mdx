Handling HTTP errors in Node.js can be a bit tricky, especially when you're dealing with different status codes and error messages. The `@ezee/http-errors` library is a handy tool that I created, that simplifies this process by providing a set of utility functions to create HTTP errors with ease.

### Why Use `@ezee/http-errors`

- **Simplicity**: The library is designed to be simple and easy to use. You can create HTTP errors with just a single line of code.
- **Customization**: You can customize the error messages and status codes according to your requirements.
- **Consistency**: By using this library, you ensure that your error messages are consistent across your application.
- **Extra Metadata**: You can attach additional metadata to the error objects for better debugging and logging.

### Installation

You can install the `@ezee/http-errors` library using npm or yarn:

```bash
npm install @ezee/http-errors

# using pnpm
pnpm install @ezee/http-errors

# using yarn
yarn add @ezee/http-errors
```

### Usage

Here's how you can use the library to create HTTP errors in your Node.js application:

```typescript
import httpErrors from "@ezee/http-errors";

// Create a 404 Not Found error
new httpErrors.NotFound({
  message: "Resource not found",
  code: "RESOURCE_NOT_FOUND",
  meta: {
    resource: "user",
    id: 123,
  },
});
```

That will build an error object with the following structure:

```json
{
  "name": "NotFound",
  "message": "Resource not found",
  "status": 404,
  "code": "RESOURCE_NOT_FOUND",
  "meta": {
    "resource": "user",
    "id": 123
  }
}
```

### Example usage with Express

```typescript
import express from "express";
import httpErrors from "@ezee/http-errors";

const app = express();

app.get("/user/:id", (req, res, next) => {
  const { id } = req.params;

  if (id !== "123") {
    return next(
      new httpErrors.Notfound({
        message: "User not found",
        code: "USER_NOT_FOUND",
        meta: {
          userId: id,
        },
      }),
    );
  }

  res.json({ id, name: "John Doe" });
});
```

### Conclusion

This library is a useful tool for handling HTTP errors in Node.js applications. It simplifies the process of creating error objects and provides a consistent way to manage errors across your application. Give it a try in your next project and see how it can help you manage HTTP errors more effectively.
