I'm Ezequiel Calonge (21), a developer and entrepreneur, born in Argentina ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡·.

I love innovation, and having the ability to change and improve people's lives. That's why I always aim to create things that simplify and have a positive impact on the environment.

Besides programming, I enjoy working out, walking, and reading.

### Current Projects

- **Chargeback Processor at NaranjaX**: An API that allows banks and merchants' acquirers to process card chargebacks in a simple way, abstracting them from the complex logic of brands (Visa, Mastercard, Amex, etc.).

- **FLUX Records**: A venture I've had since 2017. The idea is to give artists a simple way to upload songs to Spotify, iTunes, etc., earn money from it, and without any strings attached. [Read more](https://fluxrcrds.com)

- **Herkord**: A software development + marketing agency, along with a friend. We focus on helping companies digitalize and grow in the digital world. [Read more](https://herkord.com)
